  <body>
    <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>You have finished high school and are deciding whether or not you want to go to college.  You have a good GPA of 3.5 and a SAT score of 1300.  Your parents really want you to go to college and will pay for you whole college tuition.  Going to college would mean taking at least another 4 years of school, but you would be able to get into a better paying job.  Skipping college and getting a job would mean you would be done with school and would start making money.</p>

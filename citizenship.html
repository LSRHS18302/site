    <h2>What is Good Citizenship</h1>
    <p>Dicitonary.com defines citizenship as the characer of an individual viewed as a member pf society; behavior and terms of the duties,obligations and function of a citizen. I believe that honesty, compassion, respect, responsibility, and courage are necessary components of good citizenship.</p>
    <h2>Characteristics of Good Citizenship</h1>
    <p>Honesty is truthfulness, sincerity, or frankness[dictionary.com]. Honesty should be a component of good citizenship because it allows people in a  community to trust each other.  Compassion is a feeling of deep sympathy and sorrow for another who is strickenby misfortune, accompanied by a strong desire to allieviate suffering[dictionary.com]. This is important because it allows a group to feel more connecting knowing that other people care about you. Respect is esteem or a sense of the worth of or excellence of a person, a person quaity or ability, or something considered as a manifestation of a personal quality or ability[dictionary.com].

All these characteristics are assential for good citizenship because they keep the population safe and running efficently.</p>
    <h2>My thoughts</h2>
    <p>I think that the last important characteristic of being a good citizen is being helpful.  Helpful is giving or rendering aid or assistance; of service[Dictionary.com]. This is assential because it helping others in your community can help others to trust and respect you.  One recent act of powerful citizenship is when I did some community service at a food pantry.  This goes under the characteristic of being helpful because your are helping others who need the service.</p>
